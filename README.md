## Stream assignment
Complete TODO in `StreamTask` and `StreamTaskTest` classes

# `getSumSquareEven`

Please use Stream API for this task. Avoid any loops.

# `getSortedOddsArray`

All test should pass.

## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (`Control+Shift+R`)
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10` (`Control+R`)
