This is a homework for the Lambda

## IntelliJ IDEA project configuration
1. Complete all TODO tasks. Do not change the test class.

## Lambda assignment
Complete TODO in `Lambda` and `LambdaTest` classes

# `getMax`
It should return lambda expression which accepts 2 `Double`
objects and returns `Double` which is bigger from the pair.
For `getMax` please use lambda expression without method reference.

# `getSqrt`
It should return lambda expression which accepts `Double`
objects and returns its square root `Double` value.
For `getSqrt` please use method reference.
All test should pass.

## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (`Control+Shift+R`)
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10` (`Control+R`)
