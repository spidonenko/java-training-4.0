This is a homework for the Java Data Types

## IntelliJ IDEA project configuration
1. Complete all TODO tasks in the Temperature class.
2. Execute tests.
3. Add 2 more tests for each method by adding more test data.

## Temperature assignment

Implement methods in the Temperature class.
Formulas:

`F = (9*C + 160)/5`

`C = 5*(F - 32)/9`

All test should pass.
Add 2 more tests for each method by adding more test data.

## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (`Control+Shift+R`)
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10` (`Control+R`)
