This is a homework for the Java RegExp

## IntelliJ IDEA project configuration
1. Complete all TODO tasks in the RegExp class.
2. Execute tests.
3. Add 2 more tests for each method by adding the test data.

## RegExp assignment

Implement method in the RegExp class, which extracts valid IP address.
Argument: String text which might have valid IP address.
All test should pass.
Add 2 more tests for each method by adding the test data.

## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (`Control+Shift+R`)
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10` (`Control+R`)
